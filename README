Usage:
It will read from and write to the first keystore it finds in this order:
./jssecacerts
$JAVA_HOME/lib/security/jssecacerts
$JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts

Note: since java 11, run without compiling:
sudo java --source 11 InstallCert.java [--proxy=proxyHost:proxyPort] <host>[:port] [passphrase] --quiet


# Example:
java InstallCert woot.com:443 changeit --quiet
...
Added certificate to keystore /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-oracle/lib/security/cacerts using alias 'woot.com-1'
